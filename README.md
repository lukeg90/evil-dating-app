# Evil Dating App

### I created this app as an experiment to illustrate how easy it is to be evil, to make an application which claims to do one thing but in fact does not have the best interest of the user at heart. As a result, this app will never be deployed to the public.

## Key Features

  * Registration and login includes password reset option using AWS email service
  * User creates a simple dating profile
  * In the best interest of public health, user is requested to input any current symptoms
  * Backend algorithm matches user with other users based on profile information
  * Matches array is generated based on gender, interests and current symptoms.
  * __Evil black heart of the app: users with symptoms are matched to users without symptoms__
  * User can request to connect with any of their matches
  * If connection request is accepted, user has access to private chat with the matched user
  * User can manage their connections, accepting or rejecting any requests and removing any current connections
